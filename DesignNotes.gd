Sample gameplay..

- go to one of the resource aggregator screens and buy a resource
	- craigslist to rent a farm
	- Human (labour) resources:
		- fiverr for a quick job
		- task rabbit for repeat jobs
		- linkedin to hire full time
		- chat gpt
		- stable diffusion

As a time management game, time should flow even when you're looking at other screens.
Make the purchasing screens kind of like Mule's market.
- move a little avatar to establish prices, etc.

- take care not to make it a walking simulator though?


Brainstorming Ideas:
	
	Social Media + Time = Online Following
	Online Following + Product = Sales
	Product + Shipping Service = Drop Shipping
	Social Media + Ad Spend = Marketing
	Marketing + Sales Funnel = Conversion
	Website + Search Engine Optimization = Organic Traffic
	Email List + Email Marketing = Sales
	Product + Affiliate Marketing = Passive Income
	Time + Knowledge = Expertise
	Expertise + Freelancing Platform = Consulting Services

If an input requires "time", "effort", or "attention",
you can slot an accelerator in a socket to fulfil that need.
